Evolving governance via the blockchain
======================

This project is primarily an academic and intellectual resource for people working in the field of "distributed governance." It attempts to catalogue the history of attempts to implement solutions to public good problems, especially blockchains, and the intellectual milieu in which these attempts originated.

       (ii) current version: https://docs.swarm.fund/swarm-whitepaper-eng.pdf

    (b) Black Sheep (https://www.weareblacksheep.org/)

    (c) Numundo (under development)

There are several active groups which explore and attempt to promote these solutions :

     Such as the Decentralized Autonomous Society group on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/579940655425355/

     The physical meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Decentralized-Autonomous-Society-Meetup-Palo-Alto

     And an evolving thinktank
