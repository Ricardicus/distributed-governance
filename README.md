Evolving governance via the blockchain
======================

This project has evolved in three stages.

 1) 2014 lightpapers on governance and reputation
 
     (a) Distributed Governance: https://github.com/fractastical/distributed-governance/blob/master/whitepaper.md
     
     (b) Reputation ("Green Ether") https://github.com/fractastical/etherea/blob/master/green_ether.md
     

 2) 2017 Network State whitepaper (https://github.com/fractastical/distributed-governance/blob/master/Network_State_Whitepaper.pdf
)


3) Implementations of the Network State whitepaper 

    (a) Swarm Fund 
    
       (i) (v. 81, @fractastical co-author) 
       (ii) current version: https://docs.swarm.fund/swarm-whitepaper-eng.pdf
    
    (b) Black Sheep (https://www.weareblacksheep.org/)
    
    (c) Numundo (under development)

There are several active groups which explore and attempt to promote these solutions :

     Such as the Decentralized Autonomous Society group on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/579940655425355/
     
     The physical meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Decentralized-Autonomous-Society-Meetup-Palo-Alto
     
     And an evolving thinktank
