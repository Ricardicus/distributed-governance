Evolving governance via the blockchain
======================

This project has evolved in three stages.
 a) Two 2014 lightpapers on governance and reputation (e.g. https://github.com/fractastical/distributed-governance/blob/master/whitepaper.md
)
 b) Early 2017 Network State whitepaper (https://github.com/fractastical/distributed-governance/blob/master/Network_State_Whitepaper.pdf
)

c) Implementations of the Network State whitepaper 
    (a) Swarm Fund (v. 81) 
    (b) Black Sheep (https://www.weareblacksheep.org/)
    (b) Numundo (under works)

There are several active groups which explore and attempt to promote these solutions :

Such as the Decentralized Autonomous Society group on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/579940655425355/
The physical meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Decentralized-Autonomous-Society-Meetup-Palo-Alto
And several break out gropus.
