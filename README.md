Evolving governance via the blockchain
======================

The goal of this project is to be the definitive resource for attempts to build 'distributed governance' systems, including but not limited to blockchains.

##History

Early history on smart contracts includes the definitions of Nick Szabo, then implementation called 'Bitcoin' which had a 'governance only where necessary model', then the Ethereum.

 Since then several blockchains have attempted to implement governance as part of their core evolution mechanisms, including DASH, Tezos, and others.
