======================

We now have a full whitepaper describing the Network State (e.g. an implementation of the Network Stack):

The original 2014 discussion is here:

These discussion have also lead to the creation of several other groups:

Such as the Decentralized Autonomous Society group on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/579940655425355/

And the physical meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Decentralized-Autonomous-Society-Meetup-Palo-Alto
