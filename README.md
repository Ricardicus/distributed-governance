Evolving governance via the blockchain
======================

The goal of this project is to be the definitive resource for attempts to build 'distributed governance' systems, including but not limited to blockchains.

## History

Early history on smart contracts includes the definitions of Nick Szabo, then implementation called 'Bitcoin' which had a 'governance only where necessary model', then the Ethereum.

Since then several blockchains have attempted to implement governance as part of their core evolution mechanisms, including DASH, Tezos, and others.

Additionally they have followed diverse strategies regarding integration into the existing legal system. Partially due to the troubled history of early digital currencies (DigiCash, E-gold), the first generation of blockchains was built to be censorship resistant.

As second generation blockchains have obtained legal scrutiny and attempted to
