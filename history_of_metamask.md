History of Metamask

0. Joel co-founds Ethereum meetups in Silicon Valley and Ethercasts youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruzgbuOs-7X9BINIGPAsrQ). Kumavis presents his atari-themed ethereum browser / serpent interpreter at one early meetup.

1.  Joel goes to Devcon 0 in Berlin. Multiple people mention need for Javascript light wallet. Talks with Vitalik and Gav in office. They like idea. Vitalik gives name “Vapor” and said that Eth Grants would interested in funding. 

2.  Joel goes back to Silicon Valley. Converses with Martin Becze (https://github.com/wanderer) about project who is doing JS coding for the Ethereum Foundation. Starts writing project proposal. Recruits Kumavis who had already built a Javascript simulator . Kumavis said he would need funding to quit his job. Joel is currently also running bitcoin based crowdfunding platform at this time (Swarm) which is doing low volume, but project is listed there.

3.  Joel, Martin and Kumavis apply to YCombinator and get interview (https://youtu.be/p135D4Tv1mM). YCombinator states they aren’t sure about the utility of such a product and don’t give funding with the comment, "Unfortunately, we've decided not to fund Vapor. We were impressed by the three of you and the demo we saw, but we weren't convinced that this would grow large among mainstream users.... We'd be happy to hear from you again if you figure out a clearer plan to get widespread adoption of smart contracts."

4.  Kumavis begins serious work on building light client. Says his teammates at Apple might also be willing to leave apple to work on it. Joel and Martin finish the application to Eth grants (https://123mastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/VAPOR-Bursury-Application.docx), including a small carve out for design and reimbursements for Joel for costs he has incurred so far.

5.  Joel is in frequent communication with Wendell Davis of the Ethereum Foundation who is managing the program and gives indication that the grant has been awarded.
   

6.  ____ ? (There is now a well researched article that covers this period that includes input from Kumavs: https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/metamask)
    
7. Joel awakes to find the channels renamed and the GitHub organization renamed and himself removed from the GitHub organisation. Licenses indicating shared ownership of the project appear to also be removed. 
 
8. Joel later finds out the new name of the project “Metamask” is now a Consensys project.

9. Joel writes emails to people from Consensys to find out what happened but no one responds (Dec 27, 2015, Sep 8, 2016). 


Some people also ask about the history of the fox. Basically Kumavis and myself (but esp. Kumavis) were Starfox fans and we thought it would be a cool 3d logo.
