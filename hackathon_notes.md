6:45pm. Arrived at venue directly from airport. Seems like most people are already in teams.

8pm - 10pm. Whiteboarding and watching live cast. Pinged victor tron to see if swarm could fit in.

11:20pm. Finished white boarding. Leaving venue for hotel (yoga person who offered me a room is not responding). Slightly disturbed that developer that agreed to participate in hackathon with has seemingly joined another team just before I arrived at the venue. Does not bode well for long term relationship.

SAT

8:25am. Breakfast finished. official time=0

*Starting notes:* Focused. Could have gotten here a bit earlier but took my time, making sure I had adequate energy. Stamina will be key here. Flight yesterday was fatiguing and noticing a bit of sniffles, which is concerning given health. Planning to take a 1pm yoga break, otherwise want to maximize time usage.  Pushing notes to github. Got response from Viktor Tron and pinged him on Skype. Also pinged two other folks who mentioned they had possible land partners in Brazil â€” stable on the ground partners will be key for this project to succeed.

Plan is to setup Aragon. See what LD contracts they have and compare to our previous implementation, then to see what can be done to tie together a swarm interface to actual objects that would be tied to the tokens.

8:45 Designer Martin is excited about idea and seems to want to join team.  

9:06 Introduction finished. Formal kickoff.

9:15 Our own slack channel setup.

Finalized initial status of partnership for two rainforest owners in Brazil that are amenable to partnership and initial terms, as well as statement of intent.

11:30am creation of dropbox with visual assets, etc.

11:35 chat with bogdan. he apparently thought there was a different conference track that i was going to be at which is why he ended up in another team. will rejoin at some point later today after he helps.

11:40 start with dropbox paper. Listed partners

12:04 idea: automated messaging bot that handles FAQ. Pinged World Land Trust. Hard time finding Breathe related domains

12:22 have both local ethers and Visual Code environments setup. Should be ready to start coding as soon as i'm done yoga.

5:17 back from yoga / haircut. Took longer than expected. Giving up on aragon for the moment (Error: PortDuplexStream - disconnected)

5:30 decided to use existing bootstrap template and use Gov as a service "GaaS". Neologism?

6:26. Registered ibreathe.io. Looked at some earth day buzz. Talked with proof-of-walk team.
