6:45pm. Arrived at venue directly from airport. Seems like most people are already in teams.

8pm - 10pm. Whiteboarding and watching live cast. Pinged victor tron to see if swarm could fit in.

11:20pm. Finished white boarding. Leaving venue for hotel (yoga person who offered me a room is not responding). Slightly disturbed that developer that agreed to participate in hackathon with has seemingly joined another team just before I arrived at the venue. Does not bode well for long term relationship.

SAT

8:25am. Breakfast finished. official time=0

*Starting notes:* Focused. Could have gotten here a bit earlier but took my time, making sure I had adequate energy. Stamina will be key here. Flight yesterday was fatiguing and noticing a bit of sniffles, which is concerning given health. Planning to take a 1pm yoga break, otherwise want to maximize time usage.  Pushing notes to github. Got response from Viktor Tron and pinged him on Skype. Also pinged two other folks who mentioned they had possible land partners in Brazil â€” stable on the ground partners will be key for this project to succeed.

Plan is to setup Aragon. See what LD contracts they have and compare to our previous implementation, then to see what can be done to tie together a swarm interface to actual objects that would be tied to the tokens.

8:45 Designer Martin is excited about idea and seems to want to join team.
